# whitelist-script
***

## Installation
### Windows package
In Releases section, download and unzip the folder.

### With source code
Python dependancies:
* time
* keyboard
* pyautogui


## Usage
Two files are required in execution folder:
* command.txt: first line must contain the command to use (by default: ```/whitelist add```). Other lines are ignored.
* whitelist.txt: must contain your list of nicknames, one per line.

Once these two files are completed, start the program and go to your Minecraft window (you have a 5 seconds delay). Commands are sent to the chat every second to bypass anti-spam systems.
